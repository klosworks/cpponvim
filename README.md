# cpponvim

This is an attempt at providing a working, versioned, well documented configuration for programming in C++ on Ubuntu using NeoVim.

NeoVim is basically the Vim editor rewritten for more speed and plugin potential. If you are a Vim user, you will be able to use it without any learning step. If you are not a vim user, then any tutorial for Vim will apply to NeoVim.
NeoVim can be installed using apt-get on Ubuntu so don't worry about the installation.

## Environment

* Ubuntu 18.04 

  Note: Headless (server) version is supported, as normally expected with vim.

## Installation

* install c++ tools
  ```
  sudo install build-essential gdb 
  ```

* copy the init.vim file to your filesystem:
  ```
  mkdir ~/.config
  mkdir ~/.config/nvim
  mkdir ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
  cp .config/nvim/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/
  ```

* Install nvim:
  ```
  sudo apt install nvim
  ```
  This installs version 0.2.2 at the time of writing this.

* Set your vim command to neovim:
  ```
  update-alternatives --config vim
  ```
  The command will list all flavours of vim installed and prompt you to select one by typing a corresponding digit. Do that.

* Install plugin dependencies:

  For YouCompleteMe:
  ```
  sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-dev
  ```
  For chromatica
  ```
  sudo apt install libclang-dev
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  sudo pip3 install --upgrade pynvim
  ```

* Open vim and download plugins (most are installed by downloading):
  ```
  vim
  :PluginInstall
  ```
  The last command may hang at YouCompleteme.

* Install the compiled plugin components
  ```
  cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  python3 install.py --clang-completer
  ```
  For some reason, this command sometimes fails with the following error:
  ```
  CMake Error: The source directory "/home/(...)/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/cregex" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt
  ```
  If that happens, do the following, to remove the problematic directory and rebuild the compiled plugin:
  ```
  rm -fr third_party/ycmd/third_party/cregex
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  python3 install.py --clang-completer
  ```
  
* If the :PluginInstall command hanged before, rerun it.
  ```
  vim
  :PluginInstall
  ```
  
* Open vim and update the remote python plugins.
  ```
  vim
  :UpdateRemotePlugins
  ```

* That's it! you should have a working nvim setup for C++!

## Project setup: Enabling C++ context help features and semantic highlighting

To enable the smart features of installed vim plugins, the C++ project
needs to have a **compile_commands.json** file created by your build system at the folder where you open vim, or a subfolder. This file should be autogenerated. The CMake build system supports generating it.

A typical script for building a project this way using CMake is as follows:
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
(cd ..; ln -s build/compile_commands.json compile_commands.json)
make -j8
```

Please, find a Hello World application for CMake, copy the above to a build.sh script and run it in order to test your setup.

You should have compile_commands.json file appear in the root of your project, and features like semantic highlighting (e.g. members with different color than globals) and context help (such as actual class members proposed when hitting ctrl+space after typing a dot).

Note: 
open vim from the root of your project.
Even if you have subfolders such as `src/package1/module3/ddd.cpp` have console open in the parent of src and open ddd.cpp like this:
```
vim src/package1/module3/ddd.cpp
```
This will ensure that the current working directory in vim is the root of your project, compile_commands.json is found and plugins work correctly.

## Using the plugins

* Look online at NERDTree plugin documentation for some basic navigation within a project directory tree. 
* Read ~/.config/nvim/init.nvim file. You will find that it is pretty well documented inside. Please try various commands defined using the nnoremap and inoremap commands. Hint: the <leader> key is defined as ',' (the comma).
