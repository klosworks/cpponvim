# cpponvim

This is an attempt at providing a working, versioned, well documented configuration for programming in C++ on Ubuntu using NeoVim (a vim clone).

NeoVim is basically the Vim editor rewritten for more speed, responsiveness and plugin potential. If you are a Vim user, you will be able to use it without any learning step. If you are a new vim user, any general tutorial for Vim will apply to NeoVim. Only a tiny minority of plugins will be different on NeoVim. You can assume that any Vim plugin works on NeoVim until proven otherwise.

Subfolders contain tested configurations for different systems.
