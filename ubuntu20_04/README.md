# nvim + ubuntu 20.04

This approach uses coc.nvim and vim-lsp-highlight.

It is tested on WSL2. Version of nvim on the Ubuntu is 0.4.3.

The installation is mainly just following the READMEs of the individual plugins, 
being careful to install the right prerequisites (the ones in .config/nvim/init.nvim).

TODO describe the installation process.
